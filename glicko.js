Glicko-2 main function (attempts to follow the paper)

Calculate the adjustments to a player after playing against a set of opponents.

Returns an output of an object like so
{
  init:{rd, rating, vol}, //initial values before calculating
  update:{rd, rating, vol}, //new values
  change:{rd, rating, vol}, //difference between init and update
} 

rating_period should be the time in seconds in which a player typically plays
10-15 games. Default is a month. Currently not used in calculations

For system_constants, the paper says pick a number .3 to 1.2.
Adjust to achieve better predictive accuracy. Default is .75
(perhaps a function should be written to calculate a good system_constant)

factor is something I added that isn't in the paper. All outputs are multiplied by
the factor. This is useful if you want to adjust the value of the calculation -
for example 0.5 to half the weight when you are playing on a team of two players.

Team match calculator (and updater of players in the match)

Example:
teams =

on the opposing team, averaging them, and then dividing by the number of players on that player's team.
